#Texas-Instruments-BYTE-Program

This repository contains all documents and materials related to the BYTE Program organized by Texas Instruments.

📁 Contents:

The initial folders contain solutions to the weekly simulation assignments given during the program. All simulations were performed using the open-source QUCS (Quite Universal Circuit Simulator) software.

The final file contains our team's complete solution to the final project, based on a problem statement assigned by Texas Instruments.


🧠 Problem Statement:

“Distraction Monitoring Wristband”

The new generation, particularly students, faces high levels of distraction due to smartphones, social media, and environmental factors, leading to reduced productivity and learning outcomes. In third-world countries, where access to advanced technology is limited, there’s a need for an affordable, non-intrusive tool to monitor and mitigate distraction in classrooms or study spaces.

Think of what physiological parameters to monitor and how to process real-time data and provide feedback. Design a distraction monitoring device to help this cause. Think of what sensors you will use, what analog electronics may be required, what processor you will use, how the product will be packaged, etc. Be aware of power consumption, cost, battery size/weight, and cultural sensitivities.
